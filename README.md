Purpose of your project
The study used data that produces  statistical annex to Forest Products Annual Market Review 2021-2022 production and trade data for 2017-2021 for main forest products showing largest producers and traders
We aim to 
- find out the biggest exporters of selected raw materials,compared to woodfuel
- compute volume of goods abnd price obtained per metric unit of exported goods
- compare balance of trade with emphasis on trade deficit for selected countries
- explore german´s harvest and export ratio for roundwood, to further understand local industry consumption and with more data investigate wastage
- engineering wood production in year 2020

Some of our findings are
- Russia and Germany where the biggest exporters of raw materials, where as Russia had the highest volume of export, in conmparison to landmass, germany is a big heavy weight. while Ukraine exported most of the wood fuel
- Countries with low exportation data like Armenia had a better value recieved for their products over the years. The quality of products were not takien into consideration for this analysis, but it´s needed to make sense of the analysis as pricing of similar wood products greatly varies, depending on quality
- United Kingdom has some of the highest trade deficit, while Germany has a positive balance of trade
-Germany export a small ratio of her harvested wood, which is a product of her advanced wood industry


Next steps to go.
-CREATE A MODEL TO PREDICT PAST TRENDS FOR NATIONS THAT WERE IN DEFUNCT STATES LIKE SOVIET UNION; YUGOSLAVIA etc
- create a model to predict future harvest /removal 
- trace wastage from harvest to recovery of wood
